# RESTful API Study

This project is a learning playground for building a RESTful API using Express.js, Axios, and Body Parser. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/314dhan/restful-api-study.git
   cd restful-api-study

2. **Install and run the program**
npm install
nodemon index.js
nodemon server.js


3. **Explore the API Endpoints:**

   Open your favorite API testing tool or use Postman.
   Test the following endpoints:

   GET /posts/:id - Get a specific item by ID.
   POST /posts - Create a new item.
   PATCH /posts/:id - Update a specific item by ID.
   DELETE /posts/:id - Delete a specific item by ID.

4. **Technologies Used**
